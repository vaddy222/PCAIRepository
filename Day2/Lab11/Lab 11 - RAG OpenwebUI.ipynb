        "This lab provides a hands-on experience with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using OpenWebUI**. Participants will explore how OpenWebUI interacts with a **RAG pipeline** to retrieve relevant document information and generate AI-driven responses. Through this lab, learners will **log into OpenWebUI, submit queries, retrieve document-based answers, and test AI model interactions**. By following a structured step-by-step approach, users will validate the integration of OpenWebUI, the RAG pipeline, and vector-based search mechanisms.\n",

        "## **Brief Introduction to RAG**\n",
        "**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is an AI architecture that enhances language models by integrating document retrieval capabilities. Instead of solely relying on pre-trained knowledge, a RAG system first **retrieves relevant documents** based on a user's query and then uses a **Large Language Model (LLM)** to generate responses. This method improves accuracy, ensures responses are **grounded in real-world information**, and helps prevent hallucinations.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **RAG with OpenWebUI**\n",
        "OpenWebUI provides an interactive interface for users to **query the RAG pipeline** and receive **contextually relevant responses** based on uploaded documents. By integrating OpenWebUI with a RAG pipeline, users can:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Submit **queries** in a user-friendly web interface.\n",
        "- Retrieve **relevant document excerpts** from a **vector-based** search (e.g., using FAISS).\n",
        "- Receive **AI-generated responses** based on document content.\n",
